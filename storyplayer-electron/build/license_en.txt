What are the rules for using BBC StoryPlayer?

StoryPlayer is a new experimental media player that can play responsive and interactive stories created by StoryFormer, a BBC production tool.

Keep in mind that the BBC did not create and is not responsible for the interactive stories that are available to play on StoryPlayer. 

The creator that makes available an interactive story for you to view through StoryPlayer is responsible for the content. 

If you see any interactive story that you believe infringes another party’s copyright or is inappropriate or offensive or illegal then you can report it to the creator.
