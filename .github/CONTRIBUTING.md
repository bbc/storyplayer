Getting Started
===============
Before starting a pull request, please search through [existing issues](https://github.com/bbc/storyplayer/issues). If the work you want to carry out isn't captured in an issue, please open one - we want to make sure that you don't spend a lot of time working on something that we may not be able to merge into the project. 

There are issue templates available for bug fix and feature requests, so you know what information to include.

If we are able to take your contribution, you'll need to ensure you've signed and returned the [BBC Contributor Licence Agreement](BBC_Contributor_Licence_Agreement_StoryPlayer.pdf) to us before opening a pull request.

Raising Issues
==============
If you're raising an issue, be sure to give as much detail as possible. 
Issues should include:

* What you expected to happen
* What did happen
* How to reproduce the issue
* Device & Browser Details

Making a contribution - what to expect
======================================

The [StoryPlayer](https://github.com/bbc/storyplayer/) and [Object-based media schema](https://github.com/bbc/object-based-media-schema) repos are closely related, and contributions to one repo may require contributions to the other.

We're keen that StoryPlayer works as well as possible across a range of browsers and devices, so we encourage fixes for any problems you might find. However - it is a significant amount of work for us to ensure that these fixes don't impact the devices you don't have, so we will have to be circumspect regarding these kinds of contributions.

As StoryPlayer consumes JSON representations of the OBM Schema, if you are proposing a change or addition to the schema, it's likely that you will also need to make contributions to the StoryPlayer repo. Bear in mind that the OBM Schema is generalised, not specialised. We are more likely to consider changes and additions that work for the majority of StoryPlayer applications than we are for those that only address a specialised domain.
